## What i learned

- I learned how to create a responsive landing page for all devices.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the neccesary assets in the `images` folder.
